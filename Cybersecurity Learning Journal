Cybersecurity Learning Journal

Becoming a Cybersecurity Professional has been on my list of "Things I'd love to Do" for several years.
Cybersecurity sounded extrememly intimidating and possibly required more time and skills than I had at the time.
However, I decided to take a MAJOR step and kick self-doubt in the face -- I registerd for Network and Cybersecurity training at Georgia Institue of Technology.
This has been one of the best decisions I have made and is mroe rewarding than I imagined.

In addition, to the structured training, I have signed up for the following account for extra practice:
  - https://tryhackme.com/ -- To get hands-on experience with interactive labs in a beginner-friendly environment
  - https://www.hackthebox.com/ -- To try more intermediate-advance techniques
  - https://edube.org/ -- To learn Python programming language
  
  My goal is to spend 2+ hours daily using a combination of the modules, content and lab exercises from the above websites for 100 days.
  This approach will allow me to exercise discipline while learning skills that I once dreamed of.
  I will document this journey to give others that may be considering breaking into Cybersec a glimpse of the tools, resources and challenges that may lay ahead.
  
  Best,
  Anesha Sanders
